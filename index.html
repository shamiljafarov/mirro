                        <h1>Wedding Photography</h1>
                        <p>Wedding photography is often called the bread and butter of photographers — but that doesn't
                            mean it has to be boring. Quite the opposite!</p>

                        <h1>Sports Photography</h1>
                        <p>Sports photography is awesome. Sitting on the sidelines with a massive telephoto allows me to
                            get right into the action — I love shooting sports where there's a lot of explosive
                            movement.</p>

                        <p>Who doesn't love portrait photography? I love being able to capture that expression, quirk,
                            smile or whatever, that sort of defines a person.</p>

                        <p>The nice thing about shooting architecture (in my opinion) is that it's so easy to do.
                            Seriously, just pick up your camera and get out there.</p>

                        <h1>Animal Photography</h1>
                        <p>Whenever I'm travelling I always make sure to pack gear that allows me to capture the local
                            wildlife. The eagle that takes flight in this picture is probably my most prized image.</p>

                        <h1>Food Photography</h1>
                        <p>I do food photography for blogs, restaurants, influencers, YouTube channels — but most
                            importantly (if I manage to cook something that looks good) — I do food photography for
                            myself.</p>

                        <h1>Nature Photography</h1>
                        <p>Landscape photography just never gets old. Someone told me that those are the kinds of
                            pictures you never look. Well, I don't agree.</p>
